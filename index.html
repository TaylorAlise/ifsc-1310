  <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p> Most of the feedback given about my SpaceX Dragon Project was pretty consistenet with what
  I already felt needed more attention and time with. The project was really bare but much personal style 
  about the website. Needed more fonts or pictures and cohesiveness with all the pages that goes along with the project and its theme.</p>
  
  <p>While working on this project, I realized the amount and time detailed effort it generally takes to not only complete
  but creatively develop a design and implement everything an employer may require. My only regret this semester honestly is being so consumed
  with other time consuming classes that kind of forced me to put this class and project a little down my to do list. I would've love to give
  this class and project a one hundred and ten percent, however, between taking Computer Organization and Programming II at the 
  same time it began getting a little diffcult allegating my time to which projects needed more attention.</p>

  <h3>My Thoughts On Progressive Enhancement</h3>
  <p>Progressive Enhancement was idea presented by developers Steve Champeon and Nick Finck at SXSW in 2003. This perspective focusses primarily on the content. 
  The content you produce serves as your solid base you can continue to build and build on your own personal  style and interactivity.
  In other words, you begin creating your base HTML file and then layer this file your own creative CSS and then finish with your JavaScript to pull it all together.
  Progressive Enhancement is so important to include in your web developing because its so signigicant to create a somewhat experience
  for users who are discovering and journeying through your web design.
